# 🧪 Juicy Details: SOC Log Analysis Walkthrough

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) investigation based on the *Juicy Details* room from TryHackMe. Acting as a SOC Analyst, I analyzed a fictional breach against one of the biggest Juice Shops in the world using various log sources. The objective was to identify attacker behavior, compromised endpoints, and evidence of data exfiltration.

The exercise focused on interpreting logs from web access, authentication events, and server activity—developing practical skills in threat detection, log correlation, and incident reporting.

> 🔐 **Note:** Logs and artifacts from the TryHackMe room are not included here. You can access the exercise by completing the room at [https://tryhackme.com/room/juicydetails).

## 🔍 What I Did

- Investigated attacker techniques using `access.log`, `auth.log`, and `vsftpd.log`
- Identified brute-force attempts against an API login
- Traced successful SQL injection activity and its data exposure
- Confirmed file retrieval and shell access through log correlation
- Responded to simulated SOC analysis questions based on log evidence
